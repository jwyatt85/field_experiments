##### Functions:
* Calculates the ITT/CACE for a randomized controlled experiment
* Randomizer: 
    + Assign individuals (with unique ID) into treatment/control (or placebo) 
    + Blocked Randomization and SRA options available (with balance checks)
    + Runs logistic regression to see if covariates are predictive of condition placement
    + Allows a user to download the randomized list
    + Allows a user to set a proportion to treatment/control (Option only works for SRA currently)
* Calculates the power - minimial detectable effect - of an experiment (pre-experimental analysis)
